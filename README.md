Modern Fortran Edition of the SLSQP Optimizer

### Description

This is an updated version of the SLSQP nonlinear constrained optimization code. It can be used to solve nonlinear programming problems that seek to minimize a scalar performance index subject to nonlinear equality and inequality constraints as well as bounds on the variables.

Updates to the original code include:

* It has been translated into free-form source.
* It is now thread safe. The original version was not thread safe due to the use of saved variables in one of the subroutines.
* It no longer uses obsolescent and non-standard Fortran features. It should now be 100% standard compliant (Fortran 2008).
* It now has an easy-to-use object-oriented interface. The `slsqp_class` is used for all interactions with the solver. Methods include `initialize()`, `optimize()`, and `destroy()`.
* It includes updated versions of some of the third-party routines used in the original code (BLAS, LINPACK, and NNLS).
* Some new features were added to support printing error  messages and reporting iterations to the user.
* The user can now specify the max and min `alpha` to use during the line search.
* The user can supply a routine to compute the gradients of the objective function and constriants, or allow the code to estimate them using finite differences (backward, forward, or central).
* The documentation strings in the code have been converted to [FORD](https://github.com/cmacmackin/ford) format, allowing for [nicely formatted documentation](http://jacobwilliams.github.io/slsqp/) to be auto-generated.
* A couple of bug fixes noted elsewhere have been applied.
